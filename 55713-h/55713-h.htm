<p>Grown-ups talk a lot about "SEEING AMERICA FIRST." They say that this is the
most wonderful land in the world and that everyone ought to see it before going to any other
country. That is exactly what we Berry Wagon Boys are going to do, and as we travel we are
going to write this little book for other boys and girls to read.</p>

<p>Our home city, Detroit, is as interesting as any place we shall visit. We love to hear of the
days when Cadillac and his hundred men landed here and built their fort and how within a year
six thousand Indians had camped within sight of the stockade. Detroit does not look much as it
did then. It is now one of the leading Metropolitan Cities of the United States, and is growing
as fast as Jack's famous beanstalk. It has grown from 400,000 to 800,000 within the past ten
years, and it is lucky that there is lots of room for it to stretch in, for when people once get the
craze for living in Detroit, no other place satisfies them.</p>

<p>We always take visiting friends to see the sights of Belle Isle, our island park. They are
amazed at the wonderful fish in the big aquarium and interested in the zoo, the public bath house
with its 800 rooms, and the beautiful casino. After taking them to a fine lunch at the Boat Club,
we auto around the five and one-half miles of shore drive, and they "oh" and "ah" till it sounds as
though they were taking a singing lesson.</p>

<p>There is no fleet of fresh water passenger steamers in the world equaling those which call
Detroit their home port, and our Detroit River is too fine and dignified to cut up any of the
antics in which some rivers indulge. It never rises and messes up the city for it is too busy carrying
its countless boats of precious freight.</p>

<p>Detroit is a great manufacturing city, and it is quite likely that the flowers and vegetables
in your garden, the medicine that cures you when you are sick, and the auto that you ride in,
came from our city, for Detroit leads the world in these manufactures.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, if the varnish on your floors and furniture is the best that can be bought,
it came from BERRY BROTHERS.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_003.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Canada is larger than the whole United States including Alaska, and probably it would keep
on forever if the Pacific ocean did not stop it on the west, the Arctic on the north, and the Atlantic
on the east.</p>

<p>Ottawa is the capital of Canada, and the Parliament buildings are among the finest buildings
in the world. Just to look at them makes one think of kings and queens and all sorts of grandeur.
We found it hard to imagine that a little over a century ago, terrible Indian massacres were taking
place here. The Hurons and Algonquins used to come down the Ottawa river with their canoes
loaded with furs, and the cruel Iroquois used to lie in wait to torture them in order to get those
pelts.</p>

<p>Montreal, on the St. Lawrence, is another beautiful city. Here we saw great ocean steamers
unloading freight from all parts of the earth. The harbor of Montreal was the first port in the
world to be lighted with electricity, so that the loading of steamers can go on by night as well as
by day. They put in as many hours as possible, for during four months of the year the river is
frozen so that no commerce can go on.</p>

<p>In the old Chateau de Ramezay, which used to be the governor's residence, were signed the
papers which made the colony an English instead of a French one.</p>

<p>A hundred and seventy two miles beyond Montreal lies Quebec. No, it does not "lie," for
it stands way up on a high bluff above the St. Lawrence. This bluff is called the Citadel and is
one of the strongest fortresses in the world. It is sometimes called "the Gibraltar of the Western
Hemisphere."</p>

<p>Quebec is divided into two parts called the "Lower Town" and the "Upper Town," so that
the city seems to have an upstairs and a downstairs. You can climb up or down through some
queer, crooked, narrow street like Mountain Street or Breakneck Stairs, or can ride in a big
"lift" which is the English word for elevator. The Lower town is very picturesque and artists
like it, but we boys think the Upper town is much more cheerful and beautiful.</p>

<p>We often read of walled cities, but until we saw the ruins of the old wall in Quebec, we had
never seen a walled city.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_005.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>We are visiting Aunt Penelope who lives in a part of Boston which is called the "Back Bay."
The waters of the bay used to roll right where her house stands, but by filling in with earth the
Bostonians made the land and some of the finest buildings in the city stand on this "made land."</p>

<p>We can see the golden dome of the State House from our window and in walking over to see
the building we went through the Public Garden. It seems like a magical spot, for yesterday the
flower beds were filled with violets and crocuses, and today those are gone and tulips are in their
places. When these begin to fade, other blooming plants will be set out.</p>

<p>In the old part of Boston are some very narrow crooked streets and people say these were once
the path made by cows across the meadows. There are very few of these streets left and the
newer part of Boston has some of the finest streets in the world. Commonwealth Avenue is famous
for its width and costly homes, and Brookline, the finest part of the city, is said to have more
wealth and beauty to the square foot than any other city in the United States. The roads around
Boston are fine and besides the interesting buildings, lovely parks, and historic spots, one is
constantly catching glimpses of the blue harbor.</p>

<p>Climbing up the 295 winding stone steps of Bunker Hill Monument was "some climb,"
but the view from the top was wonderful.</p>

<p>Old North or Christ Church is interesting because from its belfry the two lanterns were
hung as a signal to Paul Revere to start on his famous ride, and from Old South Church the
patriots who took part in the Boston Tea Party started. They disguised themselves as Indians
so that the British would not recognize them. It took a lot of courage to pitch that cargo of tea
into Boston Harbor, and if I could choose a Boston ancestor, I would choose one of those brave
men.</p>

<p>One of the most historic spots in Boston is Faneuil Hall. It was given to the town by Peter
Faneuil as a place in which to hold town meetings, and the most fiery speeches of those old
Revolutionary patriots were made in this old building which is called the "Cradle of Liberty."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_007.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Harvard is the oldest university in America. It was founded sixteen years after the Pilgrims
landed. In Memorial Hall we saw over a thousand students eating dinner. The collection of
glass flowers at Harvard is famous. There is only one man in the world who knows how to make
them, and unless he tells someone before he dies, his secret will be buried with him. He has made
flowers exactly like those in all parts of the world.</p>

<p>We went up to New Haven to see Yale, for these two universities have been rivals ever since
Yale was founded fifty years after Harvard. The wonderful old elms on the campus are famous,
but we Berry Wagon Boys would rather see a football game between Yale and Harvard than to
see all the glass flowers or historic elms in the world. The Harvard fans would wave their deep
crimson pennants and yell: "Rah-Rah-Rah (9 times) Harvard!" Yale champions would wave
the Yale Blue, and shout: "Rah-Rah-Rah (9 times) Yale!"</p>

<p>Although Princeton is much smaller, its students love it just as well, for of course a fellow
would not love his mother any less because she did not weigh 400 pounds. Anyway, in athletics,
the orange and black of Princeton are as well known as any college colors and their yell has
cheered Princeton boys to victory on many gridirons: "'Ray, 'Ray, 'Ray! Tiger, Tiger, Tiger!
Sis, Sis, Sis! Boom, Boom, Boom! Ah, Ah, Ah! Princeton! Princeton! Princeton!"</p>

<p>The buildings of Cornell University at Ithaca, N. Y., are at the top of a high hill and the
campus is as fine as any in America. When Ezra Cornell founded this university he said: "I
would found an institution where any person can receive instruction in any subject," and when
we had been through the buildings we decided that his wish had come true. The Cornell colors
are red and white, and their yell is: "Cornell! I Yell, Yell, Yell, Cornell!"</p>

<p>West Point, is the finest military school in the United States and we wish we had space to
tell about the wonderful drilling we saw there. It is way up on the cliffs overlooking the Hudson.
The West Point colors are black, gold, and gray, and their yell is "Rah, Rah, 'Ray! Rah, Rah,
'Ray! West Point! Ar-may!"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_009.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>There is not very much of Old New York left. The great sky-scrapers have crowded out
most of the ancient landmarks, but there are a few relics. For instance, way down town is the
Sub-Treasury building. It looks like a nice dignified old gentleman dozing and dreaming of the
past, while the great high buildings around it with their rushing life are like hustling boys and
girls, full of energy and spirit.</p>

<p>Another old-timer is Fraunces' Tavern. In Washington's day it was the most popular
tavern in New York. When the British evacuated New York there was a great celebration, and
that night General Washington dined at Fraunces' Tavern. A few days later he went there to
say good bye to the generals who had served so bravely during the Revolutionary War. Those
small-paned windows have looked out on over a century and a half of New York life, and if the
old walls could speak, they could tell thrilling stories.</p>

<p>The most historic house in New York is the Jumel Mansion. In Washington's time it was
the handsomest house in the city, and besides, it had a fine situation way up on Harlem Heights
overlooking the river. It was there that General Washington made his headquarters. It is what
grown-ups call "very quaint," and the glass for the windows and the hand-painted paper for
the walls came over from France. We saw the narrow hall where the sentry paced back and
forth as he guarded Washington's slumber, and the council chamber where the general and his
staff decided so many questions. There is the cupboard where Andre, the spy, hid, but the secret
passage down to the river has been closed because of the river rats.</p>

<p>After the war the Jumels, (some wealthy French people) bought the house, and later Madame
Jumel married the famous Aaron Burr. Jerome Bonaparte, brother of the Emperor Napoleon, once
visited Madame Jumel in this house, and many other distinguished people have slept under its
roof. It is the most interesting house we have ever seen, and someway it has made United States
history seem more real than it does in the school books.</p>

<p>Anyway, when at sunset we went down to the harbor and looked out at the Statue of Liberty,
she seemed to sort of belong to us and to all American boys and girls.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_011.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>An architect said to us: "New York has a wonderful skyline." He explained that the "skyline"
is the silhouette that the buildings make against the sky. In some cities the buildings are so
nearly one height that the skyline is level and uninteresting, but in New York there are tall sky-scrapers,
low buildings, domes, towers, and smokestacks, so that the skyline is full of variety.
The picture shows the skyline of lower New York as we saw it from Brooklyn Bridge, which is
the oldest bridge connecting Brooklyn with Manhattan. It is over a mile long. The bridge
was designed by John Roebling, but he died before it was begun. His son took his place, but he
worked so hard planning and superintending the work that in three years he became an invalid.
Then he took a house overlooking the bridge, and from his invalid chair he watched through a
telescope and directed all the work till it was completed ten years later.</p>

<p>Not far from Brooklyn Bridge is the Stock Exchange, which is the most famous business
building in New York. We never knew that tame men could act as wild as they do there. It is
where they buy and sell stocks and of course they are all anxious to make as much money as
possible and everyone seems to be gesturing and screaming and no one seems to be listening. It
is as exciting as a football game.</p>

<p>After all the wild noises of the Stock Exchange, we went to the most quiet place in the city,
Grant's Tomb. We thought it would look like a cemetery, but it is a beautiful white granite
building high up above the Hudson. The inside of the building is finished in white marble and
there are the great red porphyry tombs of General Ulysses S. Grant and his wife. People who
have traveled across the sea say that Napoleon's Tomb is more showy, but we were satisfied with
Grant's Tomb. Someway it made us proud of America and its heroes.</p>

<p>By this time the sun was setting behind the Palisades on the other side of the river, and those
great cliffs looked like pictures of castles on the Rhine. The Hudson is far wider and more beautiful
than the Rhine, though, which is another good reason for "seeing America first."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>One of the finest parts of SEEING AMERICA FIRST is the trip around the Great Lakes.
They are so large that people call them "inland seas," and when you are out of sight of land, it is
just like being on the ocean. Our steamer was what grown-ups call "a floating palace," and we
learned many interesting things as we went along.</p>

<p>We never saw so many kinds of boats before. Great barges full of iron and copper ore, small
steamboats tugging a whole line of lazy big barges, fine sailing vessels looking exactly like picture-book
ships, and little naptha launches that came out and played around our big steamer when
she neared a port. The great whaleback steamers looked like angry sea monsters snorting smoke
out of their high stacks, but they are really kindly creatures for they carry immense loads of wheat
or ore from the Lake Superior region to the southern and eastern ports. Another kind of boat is
known as a "rabbit," and the pictures on the opposite page show you these queer craft.</p>

<p>People had told us that Lake Superior is twenty feet higher than Lake Huron, and we boys
were dreading the plunge which our steamer would have to make, but it was as quiet as a mill-pond,
for our boat merely sailed into a sort of box or "lock" and the water was slowly lowered till we
sailed out on Lake Huron without even a jolt. There are locks between Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario, too, for Niagara Falls would not be very easy for a steamer to climb or descend.</p>

<p>It is wonderful to watch the loading and unloading of the huge freight barges. There are
great derricks which reach out giant arms and pick up monstrous loads and carry them up or down
to deck or dock.</p>

<p>Before the Erie Canal was built, the steamers could only go as far as Buffalo and there the
freight had to be taken from the boats and loaded on trains in order to be sent farther east. The
Erie Canal crosses New York state like a great water boulevard and connects with the Hudson
at Albany and a boat sailing from Chicago can go clear to New York City and get a glimpse of
the ocean before starting back to the inland seas.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>We Berry Wagon Boys thought we had seen big machinery before, but when we went to the
huge steel mills at Gary, Indiana, we felt about as small and unimportant as a couple of undersized
ants standing before the Pyramids of Egypt!</p>

<p>Gary is called "the steel capital of the world," yet only a few years ago the spot where the
city stands was just miles of dreary sandy beach on the southern shore of Lake Michigan. Columbus
discovered America all ready-made, but Judge Gary and the other men who were in the big
steel company did not discover Gary, they actually made it! Way up in the Lake Superior country
were enormous stores of ore, but there was no coal and no limestone, so the ore had to be taken
far away to be made into steel, and the freight made the steel very expensive. These men decided
to find a place where the materials could be brought together more cheaply. It had to be on the
lake, so that steamers could haul the ore. It had to be near several railroads, so that they could
bring the coal and limestone. It had to be near a big city so that there would be a near-by market
for the steel. Besides, they needed a lot of space to grow in. They bought 9000 acres and seven
miles of that barren shore 25 miles from Chicago and they set their designers to work. The whole
thing was built on paper before they began to build it out of concrete and cement. If anything
was in their way, they just moved it. They had to move a river and a hundred miles of railroad
track. Even then they had to build four of their big blast furnaces right out in the lake. It cost
over two million dollars just to get things ready for the buildings.</p>

<p>If you were to go to Gary today and see the fine city they have built for their workers to live
in, the paved and electric-lighted streets, the pretty homes, the parks, the wonderful steel plants,
the fine harbor and the docks where great steamers are always loading and unloading, you would find
it hard to believe that all of these had grown up out of that sand in ten years.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Until today all that we Berry Wagon Boys knew about meat was that we liked our steak rare
and our pork well done, and we never thought where all the meat comes from or how it is prepared
for the market. Here at the Union Stock Yards of Chicago we have learned many interesting
things. Almost every farm in the United States has some cattle, hogs, and sheep, and out in the
far west there are huge ranches where thousands of cow-boys are employed to care for the great
herds of cattle. In Texas there is a ranch larger than the whole state of Connecticut.</p>

<p>Farmers used to kill their own stock and sell the meat in the nearest town, but now there
are great meat-packing centers to which they ship the live stock and where it is turned into canned
meat or sent in refrigerator trains or ships to all parts of the world, and because of the intense cold
in which it is kept, the meat will remain fresh for months. The packing industry amounts to
hundreds of millions of dollars a year.</p>

<p>In the stock yards of Chicago, there are over twenty miles of streets filled with huge pens,
each pen containing hundreds of cattle, pigs, or sheep. While they are waiting to be killed, they
are fed on good food and watered with pure artesian water, so their last hours are made as pleasant
as possible.</p>

<p>If the creatures could know how very useful they are to be, it would be quite a comfort to
them, for besides being made into dried, canned, smoked, or fresh meat, they furnish materials
for fertilizer, brushes, oils, glue, lard, leather, hairpins, mattresses, and many other things. The
packers say that they can use every part of an ox but its kick and every part of a pig but its squeal.</p>

<p>After the meat is prepared for the market, it is kept two days in a great chilling room where
ten thousand sides of beef can be chilled at one time.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see the sausage meat being pressed into the intestines of the pigs, for
the big machines can fill a mile of skins a minute. We saw them making lard, too, and are proud
to say that American lard is shipped all over the world and is considered the best. The reason that
American meat products are so good is because the inspectors do not allow any carelessness.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_019.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Chicago has so many fine sky-scrapers that we Berry Wagon Boys had almost passed the
splendid Harvester Building with just a glance when the man we were with stopped us and said:
"Take a good look at that building, for if a boy had not had ideas and perseverance, it would
never have been built. His name was Cyrus McCormick, and he lived in Virginia. In the blacksmith
shop on his father's farm, Cyrus and his father used to make lots of labor-saving things and
the boy decided that he would invent a machine which would harvest the wheat better and more
quickly than could be done by hand. He spent every spare minute working on the invention
and was twenty-one years old when he saw his first reaper at work in the harvest field. He thought
that every farmer would want to buy one, but it was ten years before he sold his first machine.
Soon after this he sold another and after that, the orders came so fast that he went out west to
the little city of Chicago, which was quite young in 1847, and built his first factory. This factory
was the father of the nineteen huge factories in which the International Harvester Company now
makes every machine that a farmer needs for any season and any crop." We saw only three of
these plants, but when we had been through the McCormick Works, the Deering Works, and
the steel mills and had seen all the wonderful things that are done in those factories, we did not
wonder that America is famous for its farm implements.</p>

<p>People complain a lot about the high cost of living, but if the grain had to be planted and
plowed and harvested by hand, I guess the American kiddies would have to eat their bread and
jam without the bread.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_021.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>We Berry Wagon Boys are visiting our Uncle Silas who owns a great farm of fifty thousand
acres in the northwest. When we look out over the big wheat fields that stretch for miles, it is
like looking out over a great yellow sea, only the waves are made of wheat instead of water.</p>

<p>Uncle Silas says that wheat is among the earliest known foods, and that bread is the earliest
known cooked food. The people of Egypt were eating wheat bread four thousand years ago, only
it was not like the bread we have today. It was called "koscoussoo," and consisted of flour and
water cooked together in a basket over boiling water. Wheat was brought to America by our
forefathers, and George Washington was a great wheat grower for those days. He had a mill
at Mount Vernon and shipped flour to the West Indies.</p>

<p>When Uncle Silas and Aunt Mollie came west thirty years ago, this country was just bleak
prairie and one could travel miles without seeing a sign of human life. They lived in a mover's
wagon while building a sod house. After three years they built a four-room house and they were
as proud as kings. As fast as they made any money they bought more land, so now they own miles
of this wonderful country.</p>

<p>It is great to see the threshing machines out here. They mow down those wheat heads just
as the great machine guns across the sea mow down the armies. Some of these machines are drawn
by twenty or thirty horses, and it takes as good a horseman to handle all of those horses as to do
chariot races at a circus. One of these threshers comes along through the grain like a great giant,
and with its huge claws and arms and feet, it cuts the wheat, threshes it, puts it into bags, and
weighs it.</p>

<p>The grain is shipped to some city and stored in enormous elevators until it is sold to the millers
to be made into flour.</p>

<p>Uncle Silas says that the life of the modern farmer is far from "slow." There is something
doing every minute, and when he looks out over those fields of waving wheat and realizes that he
is growing enough food there to keep thousands of people happy and healthy, he would not exchange
places with anyone.</p>

<p>Most boys and girls think of a park as a little plot of ground with a fountain in its center and
neat little flower beds arranged primly around. The Yellowstone Park is almost as large as Connecticut,
and Uncle Sam has given it to America so that no one can ever spoil its beauty by building
factories or cities there. Think of a park containing mountains two miles high, cataracts higher
than Niagara, great canyons, and geysers which are the wonder of the world. There are hundreds
of these geysers which are huge natural fountains spouting mud, boiling water, steam, and
minerals. They burst out of the ground and then sink back leaving pools where wonderful colors
seem to be painted on the rock. Each geyser has its own name and its own habits. Old Faithful
used to spout every sixty minutes to the very second, but lately takes a little more time. He is
getting old, but he still sends up a column of boiling water and steam 150 feet high, which is "going
some." The Giant deserves its name for it spouts 200 feet, while the Black Growler fusses and
mutters a lot but does very little real work. The Constant sends up a spout every minute with
only a few seconds for rest in between.</p>

<p>You would not think that with all this boiling water there could be any lakes of cold water,
but the Yellowstone Lake is as clear and cold and its fish as fine as any you could find in the
world. People claim that they have caught fish in the lake and then without moving a foot have
cooked them in a pool of boiling water. We could believe this only we do not think the soldiers
would let anyone fish there. Soldiers are stationed all around the park to keep tourists from
carrying off souvenirs. Some tourists would run away with everything but the geysers if they had
a chance. A geyser would be pretty hard to carry in ones suitcase.</p>

<p>This great park has plains where bison run wild, great cliffs where the eagles rear their young,
and forests where Mr. Grizzly makes himself quite at home. He even comes up to the hotels and
carries off garbage and though he seems quite tame, we boys did not feel like getting too familiar
with him.</p>

<p>Glacier Park is way up at the northern edge of Montana. If it were a little farther north, it
would be a Canadian citizen instead of being subject to Uncle Sam. It was the favorite hunting
ground of the Blackfeet Indians but about 27 years ago copper was discovered there and Uncle
Sam thought that the mines should be properly opened so he bought the land. There was not
enough copper to make mining pay, but there was a stock of scenery so large that it would last
forever, so Uncle Sam gave the land to his big family for another playground and the Blackfeet
Indians now live on a reservation east of the park.</p>

<p>There is lots of big game among the mountains, and the Rocky Mountain sheep and mountain
goats seem able to climb up the steep sides of the rocks as easily as a fly goes up a wall.</p>

<p>The park is named from its 60 glaciers, but is even more famous for its 250 lakes. People
used to think that they had to go to Switzerland to see the most beautiful lakes in the world, but
before long the Swiss will get the habit of "Seeing America First," for the lakes of Glacier Park
are as fine as those in the Alps. There are tiny little ones high up among the mountains and large
ones in the valleys and they are so deep and clear and still that they are like mirrors. The streams
are wonderful, too. At the Triple Divide, the water separates and goes in three directions. One
stream flows to the Pacific, another to Hudson Bay, and the third to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think that tourists have to endure a lot of hardship to visit this wild spot, but
if you could see some of these hotels (built like Swiss chalets), and could eat some of the meals
they serve, you would change your mind. The fish from these mountain lakes have a flavor that
beats anything we have ever tasted, and we have lived beside the Great Lakes all our lives. If
we could stay here longer we should join a camping party, for they have great fun living in tents,
fishing, hunting, tramping over the trails, and climbing glaciers. We will do our glacier climbing
when we get to Ranier Park.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_029.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Uncle Sam has given the American people eleven national parks covering over seven thousand
square miles of the finest scenery in the world, and Rainier Park in the State of Washington, is one
of the most wonderful of these. Think of a park containing one mountain nearly three miles high,
and having 28 rivers of ice or "glaciers" flowing down its sides. Thousands of years ago Mount
Rainier was a hot-tempered old fellow and he and the smaller peaks in his range spent their time
belching out fire, but at last in a frightful fit of passion, Mount Rainier blew off his entire head and
where his brains were is now a huge crater filled with thousands of feet of ice. The other volcanoes
put out their fires long ago, too, and now they all have snowy beards on their wrinkled old cheeks.</p>

<p>We climbed up one of the glaciers and it surely was "some climb." Everyone in the party used
an alpine stock and it gave us fellows a kind of shaky feeling in our knees when we could look down
a wall of ice a thousand feet deep into a great crevasse or crack. We were glad to stand pretty
close to the guide who was big and strong and who knows these glaciers as we boys know the streets
of Detroit. We never knew before that ice can flow like water only much more slowly. The
center of a glacier moves down the mountain about 16 inches a day. There are tiny little insects
living in this ice. We saw them through the microscope and they were hopping around as though
their feet were cold. There are wee pink plants growing in the ice in some places and they make
the ice look rose colored. They are so small that you cannot see them without a microscope.</p>

<p>Rainier Park is one of the famous wild flower gardens of the world. Blooming at the very edge
of the snow fields are miles and miles of wonderful flowers. There are daisies, columbine, larkspur,
and many others and they are much taller and finer than those in common gardens. Grown-ups
tell us boys that if we associate with great people we shall grow to be like them, and perhaps these
flowers grow so big and tall from living so near Mount Rainier and the great cedars and firs. We
do not wonder that this part of the park is called "Paradise Valley."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_031.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Fishing here on the Columbia River is not just a sport. It is a business which brings in
millions of dollars a year. There are single factories where a half a million cans of salmon are put
up in one day, and over a hundred million dollars worth of salmon have been taken from the
Columbia river since the white man first came here.</p>

<p>The large salmon are called chinook, and one of these fish weighing eighty pounds is not an
unknown thing, though their average weight is about twenty pounds. There are many small kinds
of salmon, so the chinook is called "the King of Salmon."</p>

<p>The baby fish are hatched way up in the mountain streams and as they grow friskier and
larger, they swim down the stream into the Columbia river and on to the ocean where they stay
about four years till they are quite grown up. Then they get homesick for the scenes of their
childhood, and, choosing their mates, they start back to a sort of "home-coming." It takes a long
time, for the current is strong, but if they are lucky enough to miss getting caught and canned,
they arrive at the "spawning place" after several months, and lay their eggs, and soon their little
fish children are starting out to see the world as their parents did before them.</p>

<p>The salmon are caught with traps, nets, and water wheels, and ninety thousand fish have been
caught at once in one of the large netted traps while one wheel has caught fifteen thousand fish in
a day. These wheels are covered with netting and are turned by the swift current of the river,
which raises the fish into the air and tosses them into the boat.</p>

<p>When the boat is full, it is unloaded at the canning factory at the edge of the river. The
Chinese men who kill the fish are very swift, and the machines which clean the salmon can handle
about forty-five a minute. They are then cut into pieces by machinery before being packed into
cans, and in these cans the salmon is steamed till thoroughly cooked.</p>

<p>We went through the warehouse of a great canning factory, and it seemed as though there
could not be enough people to eat all that fish, but Columbia river salmon always finds a market.
It is famous everywhere.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_033.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>There is no country in the world which has kept for its people such playgrounds as we have in
the United States. Probably that is because we are the only people who have an Uncle Sam. A
king or an emperor would never dream of putting great tracts of land aside for his subjects to enjoy
without paying a cent of toll or a penny of taxes, but our Uncle Sam has given his nephews and
nieces hundreds of miles of the most wonderful land in the world and these huge parks belong to
you and to us just as much as they do to the Astors and Vanderbilts.</p>

<p>The Yosemite Park is one of the finest of our National Parks. It is nearly in the center of
the state of California. Here you would almost forget whether it is summer or winter for up on
the mountains you are in the land of perpetual snow, while down in the valley it is like the finest
summer day and birds and flowers are as plentiful as on a June morning. There are all sorts of
trees, too. Some of them are giant redwood trees, cousins of the big sequoias. As you go higher
and higher in a mountainous country, the trees grow smaller and smaller until they become dwarfs.
Our guide showed us trees fully sixty years old whose trunks were no larger than a pencil.</p>

<p>The largest mass of solid rock in the world is in Yosemite Park. The Indians used to worship
it as the great chief of the valley and the early Spaniards named it El Capitan which means "The
Captain." On a clear day the people in the San Joaquin valley sixty miles away can see this
giant rock.</p>

<p>The cascades of the Yosemite Park are among the finest on earth. The Bridal Veil is like a
shower of lace or mist and is called "the birthplace of the rainbow," because there are so many
rainbows playing in the spray. One of the cascades is called by the queer Indian name of Lung-oo-too-koo-ya.
The Yosemite Falls would make Niagara seem like a dwarf so far as height is
concerned, though a much larger volume of water flows over the rocks at Niagara than at
Yosemite Falls.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_035.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Today we Berry Wagon Boys have seen the oldest living thing. It began to grow at least
2000 years before Christ was born, and will probably be living thousands of years from now. If
it could talk, it could tell wonderful stories of things it saw when the world was young, but it
can only stand and wave its arms gently when the wind blows, for it is just a tree. It stands with
many other giant cedar trees in Sequoia Park, California, and until a hunter discovered it in 1879,
probably no white man had ever seen it. This hunter named the tree "General Sherman," and
it surely looks like the commanding officer of this huge tree regiment. It is a sequoia tree 279
feet high and so large that twenty men standing with outstretched arms can just reach around it.</p>

<p>The Grizzly Giant, the biggest sequoia in Yosemite Park, is much more shaggy-looking and
battered than the general, and its heart has been eaten out by fire, but it is a brave old giant and
keeps right on living in spite of that painful accident.</p>

<p>The sequoias are named after Sequoyah, a Cherokee Indian who invented an alphabet and a
written language for his tribe. These trees will surely "keep his name green" long after any other
monument would have turned to dust. The sequoias are sometimes called "the Methuselahs of
the forest," but that old Bible character only lived to be 969 years old, and these giant trees are
mere babies at that age.</p>

<p>We boys think the sequoia forest the most solemn place we were ever in. The trees tower
up so high above you and make you feel so sort of small and new and useless! Then there is
scarcely a sound, and you cannot hear your own footsteps on the soft carpet of pine needles.</p>

<p>It seems dreadful to cut down trees which have been growing so long, yet occasionally one is
made into lumber. After standing for a thousand years or more in the forest, it must seem strange
to be cut into sections, loaded on flat cars, and started on a journey to some distant place to be
made into ship masts or furniture or some other thing of which the tree never dreamed when it
stood in its home on the slope of the Sierras.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_037.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The Grand Canyon of Arizona does not look like a real place. It seems like a place for
giants, everything is so huge and wonderful. It is as though some great giant had dug his house
out of solid rock. He did not make the walls smooth, but chiseled them out in strange shapes like
castles and towers and temples, and he made the sides so steep that for thousands of years no
human being dared to go down into his cellar. Instead of leaving the walls gray, he stained them
with purples and pinks and browns and reds, and yellows, so that Joaquin Miller, the California
poet, called the Grand Canyon a "paint pot 218 miles long and 15 miles wide." Our giant was a
thirsty old fellow, so he let the Colorado river flow through his cellar. When you stand on the
rim of the canyon, the river looks like a little thread of silver ribbon, but if you were to descend
6000 feet, you would discover that the Colorado is a wild, dashing, terrible river&mdash;so wild that only
a few men have ever tried to launch their boats on it, and some of those few have lost their lives
in the attempt.</p>

<p>The Indians found several trails leading into the canyon, but they did not tell their secret to
the pale-face. However, when the white men <b>did</b> discover the trails, they spread the good news
and now you can go to the very rim of the canyon in a Pullman car, can stay at a splendid hotel,
and can make the descent to the bottom of the canyon in perfect safety, for there are guides to
lead the way and sure-footed little donkeys to carry you. The "hurricane deck" of one of these
mules is not the most comfortable place to spend a day, but the views one gets on the trip are
worth all the trouble. These pictures can only give you a faint idea of the wonders of the Grand
Canyon.</p>

<p>It would be foolish for us to try to describe the scenery because grown-ups have tried it and
failed, but we would like to tell about the Hopi Indians who live in their funny little huts near
the hotel and who may be seen weaving baskets, making jewelry and pottery, and dancing their
queer dances, but this page will not hold any more words.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_039.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>It must have been a pretty dark old world before people found out about making kerosene
from petroleum, for candles and queer little lamps burning lard, sperm-oil, or camphine, furnished
all the light there was at night. All that time there were great lakes of petroleum down deep in
the earth, but when it oozed out to the surface, people thought it was a nuisance and often abandoned
their greasy farms. Later these same farms were worth a fortune.</p>

<p>It was a Pennsylvania man who first decided to bore for oil, and people thought him a little
bit flighty to do such an unheard-of thing. When his oil well began to spurt out 35 barrels of oil
a day, and people learned how valuable this oil was, the whole country got excited and in almost
every neighborhood someone bored for oil. Of course in many states they were disappointed,
but vast fortunes have been made from the oil wells of West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Indiana, Kansas, Oklahoma, California, and Texas.</p>

<p>The Texas oil fields we visited were interesting although very greasy and smelly. The great
derricks made the fields look as though a lot of war vessels were lying at anchor, for they resemble
the masts of modern battle ships. These derricks hold the heavy steam drills which bore down
into the earth. When a big gusher is struck, it sometimes spurts out a thousand barrels of oil
a day, and you may be sure that no one is allowed to be careless with matches on the oil fields,
for if a gusher or an oil tank gets afire, it is almost impossible to stop it, and immense damage is done.</p>

<p>The oil is piped from the oil fields or taken in huge tanks to some city to be made into kerosene,
gasoline, benzine, and scores of other useful articles. Nothing is wasted, for from the left-overs,
perfumes, chewing-gum, and lots of other surprising things are made. These are called
by-products.</p>

<p>On some of the railroads oil is used instead of coal in the engines, and oil is also used in large
quantities to keep the roadbed hard and free from dust. In many parts of the country there
are fine oiled auto pikes. All of these things take a lot of petroleum, and it is a lucky thing for
America that she is the oiliest country in the world.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_041.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Among all the sights that Columbus and his men saw in the new world, nothing amazed
them more than to see the Indians "eating fire and breathing smoke from the nostrils," but
evidently the explorers were not very much afraid to learn the trick from the Indians. When
they went back to Spain they took a lot of tobacco with them, and the Spanish men and women
soon had the smoking habit. It was Sir Walter Raleigh who started the fashion in the court of
Queen Elizabeth in England. It seems as though he might have found something more useful to
do. The custom grew and spread all over the world. It is lucky for us that the early explorers
did not get the scalping habit along with the tobacco habit or by this time we Americans would be
a scalpless race!</p>

<p>The settlers learned from the Indians how to grow the tobacco and before long the great
plantations of Maryland and Virginia were bringing a lot of wealth to the colonists, and people
even paid their taxes in tobacco. Today it is grown in many states and almost every land, but
the United States raises more than any other country, and when we speak of the wealth of our
nation, we must include tobacco because its sale here and abroad brings in vast sums of money.</p>

<p>Tobacco seeds are as small as grains of sand, and we BERRY WAGON BOYS have held in
our hands enough seeds to furnish plants for a large plantation. A field of tobacco is a beautiful
sight, for the plants grow quite high and have huge, smooth, dark green leaves. When the leaves
grow yellow, the farmers cut off the stalks and hang them on sticks or wires, and when the leaves
are stripped from the stems they are hauled to the "curing barn" to be "cured" or dried. These
barns are kept hot all of the time, until the leaves are cured when they are started off to market.</p>

<p>In many places tobacco is grown under great tents which make the fields look like an army
encampment.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_043.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>A cotton field is a great sight. The plants come up about to our waists and the fluffy tufts
of white cotton pop out of the green pods or bolls just as chestnuts burst out of their burrs. The
negro cotton pickers go up and down the rows many times, for the cotton does not all ripen at the
same time.</p>

<p>We saw loads and loads of cotton being taken to the ginhouse where the cotton gin picks out
all the seeds and leaves the snowy cotton ready to be pressed into bales. The seeds are not wasted
for the oil is pressed out and sold to be used, as olive oil is used in cooking and salad. Sometimes
this oil is sold to men who get mixed in putting on the labels and instead of marking the bottles
of oil with American labels, they get marked as fancy olive oil from Italy. This must be very
humiliating to the cottonseed oil, for it cannot speak a word of Italian and is ashamed of the lie
that is printed on its front.</p>

<p>When the cotton is taken out of the gin, it is ready to go to the compress and be pressed into
bales or huge bundles. A bale is about the size of a traveling man's sample trunk and the cotton is
squeezed in so tightly that the bales have to be wrapped in burlap and bound with iron bands to
keep the cotton from bursting out. These great bales weigh about five hundred pounds and we
have seen the river boats loaded down to the water's edge and railroad stations piled high with them.
They are sent to the cotton mills in various parts of our own country and in foreign lands to be
made into cloth. People all over the world use cloth that once grew on our southern plantations.
When we learned this, we looked at the fluffy tufts with new interest. Perhaps this tuft would be
woven into a Kimona for a Japanese girl. Maybe that one would someday be in the sail of a
fishing boat off New Foundland or a tent on the Sahara Desert, or a sheet on a hospital cot in
San Francisco or New York.</p>

<p>Cotton is grown some in other countries, but American cotton is considered the best and brings
in great wealth to our Uncle Sam.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_045.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>In SEEING AMERICA FIRST, we have left Washington till the last just as you have
cake and ice cream to wind up a dinner.</p>

<p>The capitol is like a great marble palace and it would be easy to get lost in those long corridors.
We saw the House of Representatives with the congressmen sitting at their desks like grown-up
schoolboys in a very handsome school-room. We climbed into the huge dome, and we went into
the Senate Chamber. The most impressive place was the Supreme Court with the Chief Justices
in their long black silk robes. We wondered how people ever dared to break any American laws.</p>

<p>We walked a mile on Pennsylvania Avenue to get to the White House, where the President
lives and has his business offices. It certainly is a fine place and its grounds and rooms are very
grand and stately.</p>

<p>The American flag never looked better to us than when we saw it floating at Arlington, the
National Cemetery, where 16000 soldiers are buried. Our country honors its heroes here and by
many fine monuments, and buildings, in the parks and squares of Washington. Some of these,
like the Lincoln Memorial, are very fine.</p>

<p>If a person were very old and had seen all the sights in the world, he might possibly auto over
200 miles of smooth pavement in Washington, visit the Capitol, White House, Department Buildings,
and Arlington without having a thrill, but it would be a dried-up old Methuselah who could
go through the Library of Congress without getting excited. We heard a man say as he stood on
the great stairway, "It is so wonderful that it takes all my words away!"</p>

<p>Best of all was our trip to Mount Vernon, the home of Washington for forty years. It is an
old-fashioned white colonial house on the banks of the Potomac river. We walked through halls
where Washington had walked, saw the queer old kitchen and brick oven where his meals were
cooked, the dining room and banquet hall where the Washingtons entertained, and the room
where "The Father of his Country" died. He is buried out in the garden he loved so well and
thousands of tourists visit the spot each year.</p>

<p>We Berry Wagon Boys are as proud of being Americans first as we are of SEEING
AMERICA FIRST! We hope that all American boys and girls feel just the same about it.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
